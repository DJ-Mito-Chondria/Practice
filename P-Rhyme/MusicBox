# A music box sort of melody, coded by P-Rhyme, August 2018

# Inspired by our initial attempt to give a harmony to Twinkle
# where we put one note in between two others that were an octave
# apart. I thought that sounded nice.

# I made up this tune. Sounds like a music box to me.

use_bpm 80

# I like the sound of this synth, too:
# use_synth :hollow

# Someone asked after class about guitar sounds, and the synth :pluck
# is the best I've found so far. Without any effects applied, I think
# this synth sounds more like a harpsichord than a guitar:

use_synth :pluck
